# MAKE YOUR OWN ENUMERABLE

> this project is built to create the `any?`, `all?`, and `filter` methods in a separate, custom `MyEnumerable` module.


## Getting Started

If you want to use your irb to test this code you need to have Ruby in you operating system to run the irb terminal.
> if you don't have Ruby installed in your machine, you can follow [this link](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-ruby/blob/main/simple-ruby/articles/ruby_installation_instructions.md
) to find instructions for all operating systems.

* To open the `irb` just type `irb` in your terminal.

* Otherwise you can just clone the repo and then run the command `ruby MyList.rb` in the terminal of your IDE to see the results.
